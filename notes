what's a port? To understand ports, let's make an analogy. Imagine that a website is like a college campus. A website has an address, referred to as the host. A college campus also has an address. The host tells the client where to go, but it doesn't specify exactly where to go. Likewise, if you have the address for a college campus, you don't know exactly which building or classroom to go to. The port is like a building/classroom; it gives the exact desination on the host.
If you're browsing the internet, chances are you're visiting the address on one of two ports: 80 or 443. 80 is typically used for sites that begin with http://, and 443 is used for sites that begin with https://. This raises the question: Why are we using 3001 instead of 80 or 443?

The truth is, there's nothing wrong with running your server on 80 or 443. However, ports with numbers 1024 and under are considered special by the operating system, and often require special permissions (like running the process as an administrator). To avoid these permission restrictions, we chose to run on a port that is less restricted. In this instance, we chose 3001, but there are plenty of other ports to choose from. In fact, port numbers can range from 1024 to 49151! We chose a number around 3000 because it is common practice and fairly easy to remember.
